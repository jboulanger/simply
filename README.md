2D Structured illumination image reconstruction
================================================

Simple SIM image reconstruction for Matlab/Octave.

To test this package use the simulation.m or acquisition.m files. The
two main function are estimate_sim_modulation() and
reconstruct_sim_base() which can be combined to effectively
reconstruct 2D images from a set of 9 modulated images.
